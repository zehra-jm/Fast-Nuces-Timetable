# Nuces-Timetable Planner 📅  

A web-based **timetable search tool** that allows users to find class schedules from an uploaded or preloaded `.xlsx` (Excel) file.  

## Features ✨

- **Multiple Sections Support**: Search for multiple sections by separating them with commas (e.g., `BCY-5A, BCY-5B`).  
- **Download as PDF**: Export the search results to a **PDF** for offline access.  

## How to Use 🚀

2. If the preloaded timetable is outdated, upload a new `.xlsx` file.  
3. Enter your **class name** in the search box.  
4. Click **Search** to view your class schedule for the week.  
5. If needed, click **Download PDF** to save the timetable.
